# Changelog

## v0.1.0 (2026-09-19)

First release.

### Added
- `classify(items, question)` and a `Client` that packs several items into one request, keeps
  several requests in flight under a rate limit, reuses one connection per worker, deduplicates
  identical text and caches answers by model, question and text.
- Yes-or-no and pick-one questions, answers in the order the items were given, with the
  probability, the distribution and the confidence.
- `bench.py`, which reproduces the table in the README against your own key: warmed connections,
  shapes in random order, p50 and p95, tokens per item, and agreement with the one-at-a-time
  baseline.
- 18 offline tests covering packing, ordering, deduplication, the cache, usage accounting, the
  limiter and the error paths.
